* Introduction
** Lecture
   - Tex files containing the test Lecture to be held on Wednesday the 22, titled /*Examples of experimental data analysis methods for Tokamak and RFP" (examples chosen by the applicants*/
   - Graphics included in the presentation are in pdf_box
   - Programs used for the creation of the graphics are both in idl/ and python/ directory



** Activites
   Presentation on current activities (both scientific and pedagocal) and plans for the future both scientific and pedagogical

*** Outline
   1. Personal research interest [1 Slides]
      1) Personal interest in turbulence in magnetized plasmas with emphasis in Fusion Plasma 
      2) I've been involved in the studies of electromagnetic turbulence, using primarly local measurement (probes both magnetic and eletrostatic)
      3) Active collaboration with a wider community (including astrophysical & basic plasmas) in order to share tools for the analysis and underlying physics
   2. Issue: Electrostatic induced Particle Flux [1 Slides]
      1) Particle flux induced by electrostatic fluctuations, and modification induced by applied shear
   3. Issue: Turbulence/Intermittency & lack of Self-similarity [2 Slides ]
      1) Evidence of intermittency observed as lack-of-self-similarity
      2) Inconsistency with SOC processes
   4. Issue: Coherent structures & filaments [2 Slides]
      1) Transport induced by coherent structures
      2) Filaments in 3 machines plus planned experiment
   5. Issue: Spontaneous Helical Plasmas [2 Slides]
      1) Helical flow & dynamo associated (mappa del flow & histogramma)
      2) Role of the flow in the high density collapse of an RFP
         discharges (pattern di velocita ad alta densita)
   6. Issue: pedagogical [1 Slides]
      1) 2 Batchelor Thesis plus 1 Master thesis: 
	 - Activities on the Filaments (ASDEX & RFX)
	 - Activities on the role of m=0 island in modyfing the
           properties of edge region
	 - Activites on the phase relation between velocity and
           magnetic perturbation during high density discharges
   7. Issue: Future activities [1 Slides]
      1) Fast ions
      2) Reconnection (sinergy with plasma science)
      3) Momentum (also considering the effect of magnetic
         perturbation on the momentum)
